# Counter App

This is a simple counter application implemented using React. It allows users to increment and decrement a counter value. However, decrementing is prevented when the counter reaches zero to avoid negative values.

## Challenges Faced
- **State Management**: Utilizing React's useState hook to manage the counter state.
- **Conditional Decrement**: Implementing logic to prevent the counter from going negative.

## Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the application.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed!
