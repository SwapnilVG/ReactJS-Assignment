# Instagram Clone

This is a simple Instagram login/signup form implemented using React. It allows users to switch between the login and signup forms by clicking on the "Log in" or "Sign up" buttons respectively. The form includes input fields for phone number, email, full name, and password.

## Challenges Faced
- **Styling**: Ensuring the layout and styling of the form elements were visually appealing and responsive.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implementing logic to switch between the login and signup forms while maintaining state.

## Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174/` to view the application.
